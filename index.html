								<h3>Shimshon C.</h3>
								<p class="overflow">"We were in need of some additional outlets in various locations in our 50 year old home. Decades of patchwork repair and outdated code standards had finally broken us down to the point we also wanted to replace the breaker panel. We spoke with Kalin at Revelation Electrical and he estimated the cost to replace the panel and put a whole home surge protector on our home. He was in contact with us from the time we scheduled the estimate till the end. He communicated with us clearly, and handled the permitting and city inspection of the repair. During the process, he remediated some electrical issues, including charred wires, outlets and missing GFCI outlets. He was ALWAYS prompt, took photos of the issues he found, and in many places, just corrected the safety issues with out even being told to do so. We decided to have him update the remaining outlets in the house as well as do a general inspection. Not only did he do this thoroughly, but with out hesitation or price gouging. I wouldn't have anyone else perform electrical work for me again in the future. Thanks Revelation!"</p>

								<p class="overflow">"I definitely wanted to use a licensed electrician for some residential electrical work. I contacted Revelation who promply provided a reasonable quote for the work to be done. We scheduled a time on a Saturday and Kalin showed up right on time ready to go. He added a new electrical circuit with a new breaker to my electrical box and two new wall oulets. He was very proficient and readily answered all my questions as he worked. He also took care to make sure everything was cleaned up when he was finished. I highly recommend Revelation for any electrical work."</p>
