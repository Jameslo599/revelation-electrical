This is a website I built for Revelation Electrical Services for the purpose of driving more traffic to his business and bolstering his online presence. It was a pleasure working with the CEO Randy on this project who provided me everything I needed to make this a success.

Here is a link to my portfolio website: https://www.revelationelectrical.com

How it's made: Tech used: HTML, CSS, Sass, Javascript, jQuery

Lessons learned: This was a great learning experience in how to work with a client and using soft-skills to interact and respond to a client's concerns/questions. I also learned the importance of having interchangeable components to speed up development and deliver the project ahead of time.
