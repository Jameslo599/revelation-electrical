## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, jQuery

Randy was my very first client when I embarked on my freelancing journey, and I consider myself incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunity to assist him with his business website. This experience marked the beginning of my freelance career, and it taught me crucial skills, such as creating effective mockups and presenting them to clients. Moreover, it provided me with valuable insights into the specific needs of my target audience (electricians) when it comes to website design and the importance of meeting deadlines.

Upon visiting the website, visitors are welcomed by the Revelation logo, prominently positioned above the business name, slogan, and clear call-to-action buttons. Notably, the logo's vertical orientation necessitated thoughtful design adjustments for proper alignment. Navigation is made effortless through a user-friendly right-sided menu bar, powered by jQuery, which enables smooth scrolling to different sections of the website. As users scroll down, they encounter informative sections about Randy and his business, complemented by captivating images showcasing his work, along with an embedded custom Google Maps service area.

The services section offers a comprehensive range of services provided by Randy for potential clients. Some of these services are linked to articles that I've written on his behalf, aiming to offer valuable information and enhance search engine optimization. Further down the page, a testimonial carousel highlights the outstanding work delivered to past clients.

The website also includes a standard contact form, meticulously designed to cater to various business needs. Similarly, the footer provides a wealth of essential components, including social media links and accepted payment methods, making it a convenient one-stop destination for accessing vital information.

## Optimizations

To improve the website's loading speed, I've focused on optimizing image resolutions for select images and minimizing unnecessary JavaScript that may hinder the site's rendering process. I have chosen to utilize Google Tag Manager for all my business websites, though this has occasionally presented challenges in terms of rendering speed. Rest assured, I am actively addressing this issue to enhance the website's overall performance.

## Lessons Learned:

Working with Randy has been a delight. He not only provided me with my first opportunity to work as a software developer in a real-world environment but also remains one of the most pleasant individuals I've had the privilege of collaborating with.
